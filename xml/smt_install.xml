 <title>&smt; Installation</title>
 <info/>
 <para>
  &smt; is an add-on product for &sls; 11 systems. You can either install the
  &smt; add-on together with your &sls; base system during the initial
  installation process, or on top of an already-installed base system at any
  later time. &smt; can be obtained free of charge from <link
  xlink:href="https://download.suse.com/"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  If you install &smt; on top of SLES with the latest maintenance patches
  applied, you may get dependency errors in some cases if you do not also
  use the latest &smt; patches. To avoid those dependency errors, re-run
  Novell Customer Center (&ncc;) Configuration in &yast; right after
  you have added the &smt; installation repository to your system, but
  before you install any packages from &smt;. This way the &smt;
  update repository will be properly available to your system.
 </para>
 <para>
  It is recommended to to check for &smt; updates available immediately
  after installing the product. SUSE continuously releases maintenance
  updates for &smt;, and newer packages are likely to be available
  compared to those installed from media, for example using the
  <command>zypper patch</command> command.
 </para>
 
 <note>
  <title>Installation Scope</title>
  <para>
   SMT is a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) based application. During the
   installation, Apache and MySQL will automatically be installed if missing.

  <title>Migration between &scc; and &ncc;</title>

  <para>
   &smt; can talk to only one registration service (&scc;, &ncc;,
   alternatively also &slms;). The switch between the registration
   servers can be done either via a &yast; module or command-line tools.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before performing the switch between customer centers, make sure that the
   target customer center serves all products that are registered against
   &smt;. Both &yast; and the command-line tools perform a check to
   find out whether all products can be served with the new registration
   server. If it is not possible, the only option is to install two parallel
   &smt; instances and to synchronize products from both &scc; and
   &ncc;.
  </para>

  <para>
   To perform the migration to &scc; via command-line, use:
  </para>

<screen>
smt ncc-scc-migration
  </screen>

  <para>
   If you need to revert back from SCC to NCC, use:
  </para>

<screen>
smt scc-ncc-migration
  </screen>

  <para>
   The migration itself is time-consuming and during the migration process
   the &smt; server may not be able to serve clients that are already
   registered.
  </para>

  <para>
   The migration process itself changes the registration server and the
   proper type of API in the configuration files. No further (configuration)
   changes are needed on the &smt;.
  </para>

  <para>
   To migrate between &ncc; and &scc; via &yast;, use the &yast;
   smt-server module.
  </para>

  <para>
   After migration is done, it is needed to re-synchronize &smt; with the
   customer center. It is recommended to assure that the repositories are
   up-to-date. This can be done using the following commands:
  </para>
